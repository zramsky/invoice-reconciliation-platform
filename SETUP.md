# Invoice Reconciliation Platform - Setup Instructions

## ðŸŽ‰ Your platform is now fully functional!

### What's Working:
- âœ… Complete frontend deployed to Firebase: https://contractrecplatform.web.app
- âœ… Python Flask backend with proper file storage and serving
- âœ… Contract viewing without blank tabs (FIXED!)
- âœ… Vendor management with CRUD operations
- âœ… Automatic fallback between backend and localStorage
- âœ… File upload and preview system

### Current Setup:

#### Frontend (Production)
- **URL**: https://contractrecplatform.web.app
- **Status**: Live and deployed
- **Features**: Full vendor management, contract upload, analytics dashboard

#### Backend (Local - Working Perfectly)
- **URL**: http://localhost:5001
- **Status**: Running and functional
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - `/api/health` - Health check
  - `/api/vendors` - List/create vendors
  - `/api/vendors/{id}` - Get specific vendor
  - `/api/vendors/{id}/contract` - View contract files

### How to Use:

1. **Start Local Backend** (in terminal):
   ```bash
   cd /Users/zackram/invoice-reconciliation-platform
   python3 test-backend.py
   ```

2. **Access Your Platform**:
   - Open: https://contractrecplatform.web.app
   - The frontend automatically detects if you're running the local backend
   - When local backend is running: full functionality with proper file serving
   - When backend is offline: falls back to localStorage (limited functionality)

3. **Test Contract Viewing**:
   - Go to https://contractrecplatform.web.app
   - You should see existing vendor "Rumpke Waste & Recycling"
   - Click "View Profile" â†’ "View Contract" 
   - Contract now opens in new tab properly (no more blank tabs!)

### Current Vendor Data:
- **Vendor**: Rumpke Waste & Recycling
- **ID**: 1e54e3f3-073d-4029-b3a4-1fae10bca177
- **Contract**: Sample waste management contract
- **Test URL**: http://localhost:5001/api/vendors/1e54e3f3-073d-4029-b3a4-1fae10bca177/contract

### Cloud Deployment Status:
- **Railway**: Free tier limited to databases only
- **Render**: Multiple deployment failures (502 errors)
- **Vercel**: Authentication required
- **Fly.io**: Payment information required

For now, the local backend provides all functionality you need. When you're ready for cloud deployment, we can explore paid hosting options or set up authentication for free tiers.

### File Storage:
- **Location**: `uploads/vendors/{vendor-id}/`
- **Sample File**: `uploads/vendors/1e54e3f3-073d-4029-b3a4-1fae10bca177/sample-contract.txt`
- **Format**: Original filename preserved, secure handling

### Next Steps (Optional):
1. **Add More Vendors**: Use the "Add Vendor" button on the dashboard
2. **Upload Real Contracts**: Test with your actual contract files
3. **Cloud Deployment**: Set up paid hosting when needed
4. **Authentication**: Add user management if required

Your platform is ready to use! The main issue (blank tabs for contract viewing) has been completely resolved with proper backend file serving.
