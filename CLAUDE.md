### Shared Files (Coordination Required)
- `README.md` - Product instance manages
- Git configuration files - Infrastructure instance manages
- Any new configuration files - Must declare ownership

### Communication Protocol

1. **Start of Session**: Update your status below
2. **File Changes**: Log major changes in the Activity Log
3. **Conflicts**: Use the Conflict Resolution section
4. **Handoffs**: Document in the Handoff section

### Current Status

**Frontend Instance**: Working on UI/UX improvements
**Backend Instance**: COMPLETED - LLM optimization and API enhancement finished
**Infrastructure Instance**: COMPLETED - Security infrastructure, CI/CD, and deployment optimization
**Product Instance**: Active - Bill.com API integration implementation

### Activity Log

**2025-08-16 (Current Session)**

  * Batch processing engine for high-volume document processing
  * Comprehensive API metrics and monitoring
  * API versioning with backward compatibility
  * Database optimization with indexing and connection pooling
  * Advanced LLM prompt optimization and token management
- Infrastructure Instance: Firebase optimization and CI/CD setup
- Product Instance: Activated for cross-component integration assessment
- Product Instance: COMPLETED Vendor Management System implementation:
  * Database schema with vendors, aliases, renewals, and performance tracking
  * Full REST API with authentication integration (/api/vendors/*)
  * Frontend UI with tabbed interface for vendor management
  * Auto-discovery of vendors during reconciliation process
  * Vendor alias management for business name variations
  * Contract renewal tracking with notifications

  * Database methods for storing and tracking Bill.com synced data
  * Full REST API endpoints (/api/billcom/*) with rate limiting and error handling
  * Modern Bill.com integration management UI with configuration and sync controls
  * Real-time sync status tracking and comprehensive error reporting
  * Data normalization between Bill.com and Unspend formats
  * Integration with existing vendor management and authentication systems

### Conflict Resolution

When conflicts arise:
1. The instance that owns the file has priority
2. Cross-cutting changes must be coordinated through Product instance
3. Shared files require explicit coordination before editing

### Handoff Requirements

Before merging to main:
1. All instances must complete their work
2. Integration testing by Product instance
3. Deployment verification by Infrastructure instance
4. UI/UX sign-off by Frontend instance

### Next Coordination Meeting

Schedule: When major features are complete
Agenda: Integration, testing, deployment strategy
